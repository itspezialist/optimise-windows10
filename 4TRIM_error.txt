error:
Optimize-Volume : The volume optimization operation requested
is not supported by the hardware backing the volume.                                                               
Activity ID: {0e83dfba-0728-407e.....}     

The error message suggests that the requested operation is not
 supported by the hardware backing the volume. This could mean
 that the hardware does not support the "ReTrim" operation, 
which is used in the Optimize-Volume cmdlet to reclaim unused
 space from solid-state drives (SSDs).




To resolve this error, you can try removing the "-ReTrim" 
parameter from the Optimize-Volume cmdlet, like this:                                                                                                                         In Zeile:1 Zeichen:1                                                                                                                                                             + Optimize-Volume -DriveLetter C -ReTrim -Verbose                                                                                                                                + ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                                                                                                                    + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (StorageWMI:ROOT/Microsoft/...age/MSFT_Volume) [Optimize-Volume], CimException                                                           + FullyQualifiedErrorId : StorageWMI 43022,Optimize-Volume  



Disable or remove this line
#Optimize-Volume -DriveLetter C -ReTrim -Verbose 

Enable or rplace this line
Optimize-Volume -DriveLetter C -Verbose


This will perform a default optimization of the C drive
without using the ReTrim operation. If you still get an error, 
it could mean that your hardware does not support any optimization 
operations, in which case you may
need to use a third-party defragmentation tool or contact the 
hardware vendor for support
